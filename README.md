# Introduction
This glove is designed to facilitate communication between deaf and dumb people.
## Function
   - Chinese mode<br/>
     The gloves read out the corresponding Chinese by recognizing sign language gestures.

   - English mode<br/>
     The gloves read out the corresponding English letters by recognizing sign language gestures.
   - Auto play mode<br/>
     The gloves read out the user-defined common language by recognizing sign language gestures.

# Hardware and Software Setup
## Required Hardware   
   - 1 DesignWare ARC EM Starter Kit(EMSK)
   - 1 Acceleration sensor(JY-901)
   - 1 Speech recognition module(SYN6288)
   - 1 AD converter(PmodAD2)
   - 1 OLED display module(SSD1306)
   - 1 Speech recognition module(YS-LDV7)
   - 1 GPS(C3-470A)
   - 1 GPRS(SIM900A)
   - 1 SD Card
   
## Required Software
   - Metaware or ARC GNU Toolset
   - Serial port terminal, such as putty, tera-term or minicom

## Hardware Connection
   1. The EMSK implement smart gloves,it will processe the data collected by sensors and translate gestures to corresponding sign language, we can get the corresponding sign language information by displaying text and making voice.
      - Connect JY-901 to J1(Using UART interface)
      - Connect SYN6288,PmodAD2 and SIM900A to J4(Using I2C interface)
      - Connect C3-470A to J5(Using UART interface)
      - Connect SSD1306 to J2(Using I2C interface)
      - Connect YS-LDV7 to J3
   2. Configure your EMSKs with proper core configuration
