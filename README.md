# Smart Sign Language Translation Gloves
This application is designed to help deaf-mute to communicate with normal people,The master sign language can convert sign language into text and display on screen, at the same time the voice broadcast. This application facilitates the communication between deaf-mute and the outside world.

# Introduction
The master sign language can help deaf-mute to communicate with normal people.
## Function
   - **Chinese mode**<br/>
     The processor recognizes the **Chinese sign language**, then the screen displays the recognition result and at the same time plays the recognition result.

   - **English mode**<br/>
     The processor recognizes the **English alphabet** sign language, then the screen displays the recognition result and at the same time plays the recognition result..

   - **Auto play mode**<br/>
     The processor recognizes the user's **predefined sign language** and plays a predefined voice.
   - **Voice Recognition**<br/>
     The processor recognizes the **voice of normal people** and displays it on the screen for the deaf-mute to watch.

   - **Danger warning**<br/>
     After the processor recognizes the horn sound, the user is alerted to the vehicle in a **vibration** manner.

   - **One-click assistance**<br/>
     When in trouble, users can send their location information to their families for help.

## System Architecture
   As shown in the figure below, the system consists of **three parts: input, master, and output**.
   - The **input** include collecting gesture data,recognizing the voice of normal people and positioning the location of the user.
   - The **master** is composed of an ARC processor. It mainly performs data processing and matching with a gesture library according to an algorithm, and sends a corresponding command to the output terminal at the same time.
   - The **output** include senging message to guardian.

# Hardware and Software Setup
## Required Hardware   
   - 1 DesignWare ARC EM Starter Kit(EMSK)
   - 1 Posture sensor(JY-901)
   - 1 Voice composite module(SYN6288)
   - 1 AD converter(PmodAD2)
   - 1 OLED display module(SSD1306)
   - 1 Voice recognition module(YS-LDV7)
   - 1 GPS(C3-470A)
   - 1 GPRS(SIM900A)
   - 1 SD Card
   
## Required Software
   - ARC GNU Toolset
   - Serial port terminal, such as putty, tera-term or minicom

## Hardware Connection
   1. The EMSK implement smart gloves,it will processe the data collected by sensors and translate gestures to corresponding sign language, we can get the corresponding sign language information by displaying text and making voice.
      - Connect JY-901 to J1(Using UART interface)
      - Connect SYN6288,PmodAD2 and SIM900A to J4(Using I2C interface)
      - Connect C3-470A to J5(Using UART interface)
      - Connect SSD1306 to J2(Using I2C interface)
      - Connect YS-LDV7 to J3
   2. Configure your EMSKs with proper core configuration
   - EMSK connection

# User Manual
## Before Running This Application
  Download source code of Master Sign Language from github.
  - The hardware resources are allocated as following table.
  
| Hardware Resource  | Functioon                      |
| ------------------ | -----------------------------  |
| JY-901             | Acceleration and angle sensor  |

## Run This Application
  Here take EMSK2.0 - ARC EM7D with GNU Toolset for example to show how to run this application.We need to use embARC bootloader to automatically load application binary for different EMSK and run. See embARC Secondary Bootloader Example for reference.
  * Modify emsk_init.c (/board/emsk/common/emsk_init.c)
 ```

### Makefile
   - Target options about EMSK and toolchain

```
         BOARD ?= emsk
         BD_VER ?= 20
         CUR_CORE ?= arcem7d
         TOOLCHAIN ?= gnu
```
   - The relative series of the root directory, here the path of the Makefile is .\embARC\example\emsk\sign language/makefile:
```
         #
         # root dir of embARC
         #
         EMBARC_ROOT = ../../..
         MID_SEL = common u8glib
```  
  See embARC Example User Guide, "Options to Hard-Code in the Application Makefile" for more detailed information about Makefile Options
  
  - Driver<br/>
  Placing the drivers' source code in driver folder, you can see there are subfolders for data,judge,draw and gprs drivers. Placing the C source file and header file in the corresponding subfolder.

| folder/file      | Function                                           |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------  |
| data             | get and deal with data from sensor                 |
| draw             | OLED driver                                        |
| gprs             | send position information                          |
| judge            | match the collected data with the sample database  |
